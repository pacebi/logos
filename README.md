# Logos
Repo for the Pacebi Alliance logo and its usage

## Logo
The logo is comprised of four pride flags (pan, ace, queer chevron, bi) in five columns.<br>
The logo as a whole is in a ratio of 1:1. In order from left to right, the column ratios are 3\:2:3\:2:3.<br>
In order from top to bottom, the row ratios are 1\:1:1 (pan) 1\:1\:1:1 (ace) 2\:1:2 (bi). The queer chevron flag was eyeballed; the ratio would be impractical to write.<br>
Refer to the SVG for exact measurement and colour.<br>

## Usage
There are two versions of the logo for use, the SVG and the PNG.<br>
Note that per the Creative Commons, the SVG and PNG guidelines are only suggestions and not officially enforced. We suggest you follow these, however, for consistency of the Pacebi brand.

### SVG
The SVG is to be used in all possible cases that permit or have the capacity for SVG vector graphics.<br>
The SVG is provided in this repo.

### PNG
Use the PNG only in cases where SVG vector graphics cannot be used.<br>
You can make a PNG version of the logo by downloading the SVG and opening it in a vector graphics editor (such as Inkscape) and exporting the image to your desired resolution.<br>
Alternatively, you can download the PNG provided in this repo, measuring 3000Ã—3000 pixels.

### Trademark
As the Creative Commons concern copyright, not trademark, you must still respect the Pacebi Logo as such. Do not use the Pacebi Logo in a way that it makes people believe your work is officially from or endorsed by the Pacebi Alliance.
